# HackaServe
### A tool for people foolish enough to run hackathons.
HackaServe is a simple text message delivery system for hackathons and other events which uaes your twilio account to 
despatch messages to all your attendees, or sub groups of them.

To begin using HackaServe, run

```bash
    $ npm i hackaserve -g
```

I hate installing stuff globally, personally, but hey, it's a CLI so I'll make an exception


Run the following commands and it'll show you how to use the tool

```
    $ hackaserve -h
```

## Get going with a simple hackathon or event

Once hackaserve is installed, you can start using it, get a new
hackathon going with the following command

```
    $ hackaserve init HackLondon -x
```

This will create a new Hackathon folder with the name HackLondon in 
the directory you call the command from.

inside you'll find two YAML files, the first is called hackathons.yml

```yaml
    name: HackLondon
    description: ''
    twilio_account_id: null
    twilio_api_key: null
    twilio_phone_number: null
    messages:
    - name: first_message
        text: 'HackLondon: Lunch is now served in room K1.42'
        group: all
        type: once

```

this will contain info about your hackathon and the messages you plan to send
during the hackathon, don't worry we can add more either manually or via the CLI

The second one is generated by the ```-x``` command

```yaml

```
